Laurens Recipe Database: Solution Requirements
Lauren is an aspiring chef. Every time she creates a new recipe, she writes the recipe down in a notebook, recording:
1. The ingredients,
2.  Ingredient measurements, 
3. The method to create the meal
4. How many people the meal will serve.

Over time, her notebook has become slightly worn and also quite dirty from messes and spills while cooking. Lauren is worried that the book will soon become too damaged to read some of the recipes, especially the older ones. She wants to transfer all of her recipes to a database, with the ability to add new recipes as well and display a list of all her recipes

__**Solution needs to be able to add and retrieve recipes**__

1	Add new recipe to application

a	Add ingredients and their measurements (amounts should be separated from the ingredient name)

b	Add recipe method (in paragraphs – paragraphs do not need to be separated)

c	Add number of people the meal will serve (numeric)

d	Submit recipe to data base
       e  Include a button that will show all recipes in database

All recipes must have a name, at least one ingredient with a measurement, a method and a record of the number of people that the meal will serve.
